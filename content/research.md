## Open-Source Software

*FRK*, an R package for carrying out spatial and spatio-temporal fixed rank kriging on massive datasets. It caters for both Gaussian and non-Gaussian data, and it facilitates spatial change-of-support.  Available on CRAN.

*testarguments*, an R package which automates the testing of any user-defined prediction algorithm over an arbitrary number of arguments. Available on CRAN.
